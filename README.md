**DISCLAIMER: This mod may contain spoilers from Undertale, currently mild, but will increase further down the line. If you want to follow this, and don’t want the spoilers, I suggest you try out Undertale for yourself (preferably all 3 routes, but if you don’t want to do one that is ok as well)**

## Features

### Items
#### Weapons
I have done all the weapons, in basic form. Most of them don’t have custom models yet. Yes, I do know that the model for the tough glove sucks, I haven’t gotten around to making a good one for it yet. In addition, the items only give damage, and a cool down timer how I see fit. All of the textures are the steam badge icons edited (by removing the respective soul colour from around the outside), the only exception is the worn dagger, that either doesn’t have one, or it isn't listed on the wiki, so I just poorly edited the True Knife texture.
